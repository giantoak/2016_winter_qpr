The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nanos extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nanos magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nanos sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun manufactured in Turkey by Ucyildiz Arms. The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar. The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed. The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer. The MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal chokes. The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location. The manual safety also duplicates the M16 style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip. The top of the receiver has a carrying handle and integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or any optical accessories. The MKA 1919 12 gauge shotgun is appropriate for all levels of hunting and sporting enthusiasts. It comes in Black and “BONZ” camo version(MSRP $1075, contact us for our price).

It was widely used by U.S. and foreign military, paramilitary and police forces, and has also been a popular civilian firearm. In selective fire versions capable of fully automatic fire, the carbine is designated the M2 carbine. The M3 carbine was an M2 with an active infrared scope system. Unlike conventional carbines, which are generally a version of a parent rifle with a shorter barrel (like the earlier .30-40 U.S. Krag rifle and carbine and the later M16 rifle and M4 carbine), the M1 carbine has only one minor part in common with the M1 rifle (a short buttplate screw) and fires a different cartridge."],"_type":"win-custom-built-barrel-with-scope","name":["M1 Carbine 30 caliber semi-automatic rifle"],"views":["529 total views, 1 today"],"url":"http://shooterswap.com/guns-for-sale/m1-carbine-30-caliber-semi-automatic-rifle/","image":["http://shooterswap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/626992.jpg"],"author":["gregt"],"listed_on":["Listed on September 5, 2012 onto Rifles"],"_template":"6cc5ec39847ae6af633a7ba5ead35958cac41797","location":["Location:"],"_cached_page_id":"8fca860d296a736916336e275fa2eab769a1c56f","price":["600"],"details":["Details: State: Florida Listed: September 5, 2012 11:11 am Expires: This ad has expired No Tags Ad Reference ID: 615047326f128cb"]},{"_type":"win-custom-built-barrel-with-scope","description":["Description This is a 9mm pistol.

Below is a brief history of the gun: The M1 carbine (formally the United States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1) is a lightweight, easy to use semi-automatic carbine that became a standard firearm for the U.S. military during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and was produced in several variants. It was widely used by U.S. and foreign military, paramilitary and police forces, and has also been a popular civilian firearm. In selective fire versions capable of fully automatic fire, the carbine is designated the M2 carbine. The M3 carbine was an M2 with an active infrared scope system. Unlike conventional carbines, which are generally a version of a parent rifle with a shorter barrel (like the earlier .30-40 U.S. Krag rifle and carbine and the later M16 rifle and M4 carbine), the M1 carbine has only one minor part in common with the M1 rifle (a short buttplate screw) and fires a different cartridge."],"_type":"win-custom-built-barrel-with-scope","name":["M1 Carbine 30 caliber semi-automatic rifle"],"views":["530 total views, 2 today"],"url":"http://shooterswap.com/guns-for-sale/m1-carbine-30-caliber-semi-automatic-rifle/?replytocom=791","image":["http://shooterswap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/626992.jpg"],"author":["gregt"],"listed_on":["Listed on September 5, 2012 onto Rifles"],"_template":"6cc5ec39847ae6af633a7ba5ead35958cac41797","location":["Location:"],"_cached_page_id":"d51b74cc4ed93fbecfc1f257b2b741a4e9743a69","price":["600"],"details":["Details: State: Florida Listed: September 5, 2012 11:11 am Expires: This ad has expired No Tags Ad Reference ID: 615047326f128cb"]},{"_type":"win-custom-built-barrel-with-scope","description":["Description This is a 9mm pistol.

It was bought from a friend of my parents whose father brought it back from Germany after WWII. Aside from occasional firings it has been kept in it’s hard shell holster in a lock box. According to the serial number it was made in late 1943 or 1944. The gun is marked on both the left and right sides with the Nazi 359 stamp. The serial number is 192 d ac 44. The only issue with the gun is that it needs a firing pin cover which came off the last time it was fired. The absence of this part does not prevent the gun from firing and the part sells on various sites for no more than $30. It is a sweet shooting gun that is deadly accurate.

Most of the lugars you fine were broken down and then reassembled when they arrived in the US leaving mismatched serial numbers throughout each gun. But not this one, I have 2 clips and a owners manual. This was given to me by my Grandfather who is a surviving D-Day Veteran of the Ohmaha Beach Campain; he also was the 7th Allied Soljier to step into Buchanwald. This pistol was manufactured in 1917 during WWI and found my Grandfathers hand in Germany as the only weapon he carried as a medic along with an F&S Fighting Knife made by Wilconson Sword. I ran 50 rounds through it when I first got it 10 years ago and it shot like a dream and the toogle action worked perfect and the rounds grouped perfect and not a single jam. It needs to find its way to a gun collector looking for a special piece of history that one could defend their home today with. Again, its a very special piece.

External Dimensions: 30″ W x 25″D x 60″ Tall Door Thickness: 7/16″ Wall Thickness : 5/16″ Bolt thickness : 1″ chrome This safe is about twenty years old. I replaced the original electronic lock with the AmSec model ES10XL lock just under four months ago. The outside has some scratches and one patch above the panel where a sticker was removed, but overall the outside is in ok condition. The pictures below highlight the damage a little more than it actually shows in real life. We carpeted the inside, and built a set of adjustable shelves for the left side. All of the shelves are removable and the carpet was just glued to the side so it’s also removable. The inside of the door is carpeted, and there are four rows of hooks for keys, belt buckles, or whatever. There is a hole in the back of the safe just large enough for a plug, and we have a dehumidifying rod in one corner that comes with the safe. We built a carpeted 13″ pedestal for the safe, so you don’t have to bend down as much. The wall thickness is on this safe is about twice as much as current safes you’d find at Cabela’s or similar. American Security doesn’t make a safe this heavy duty anymore, but Barret does. You can see a price sheet here: http://s3.amsecusa.com.s3.amazonaws.com/barrett/Barrett-GunSafes-Retail-Aug2011.pdf I’d be glad to talk to you about it on the phone, but you’ll need to send me an email to prove you’re not a robot.

Been in case since 2006 when its was bought. spent just over 15k for it. Quotes about the gun: The splendid Giubileo over-and-under Beretta 20 gauge field models, is distinguished by rich, baroque spiral and floral engravings on the receiver and side plates, and by its exquisitely proportioned construction. There are no screws on the plates, allowing the master engravers to express their artistry in full, while the internal surfaces and mechanisms are impeccably polished. The elongated trigger guard, the safety and top lever are also completely engraved. The Giubileo shares the other characteristics with the 687 over-and-under.

It is recoil-operated, locked breech firearm that uses improved Browning linkless locking principle. The gun is striker fired, and unlike many other striker-fired guns, like Glocks, Forty-Nine is a true DAO gun, with availability of re-striking the misfired cartridge simply with another trigger pull. The striker is completely at rest until the trigger is pulled, so gun is safe. It has no external safety switches or decockers for simplicity and readiness to use. The main drawback of this system is long and heawy trigger pull – almost 10 lbs (ca. 4.5kg). The frame of the gun is made from black polymer, the slide is made from stainless steel. Gun also has acessory rails on the frame under the barrel, for quick and easy mounting of the laser designators and flashlights contact directly via …highchemltd@hotmail.com"],"_type":"win-custom-built-barrel-with-scope","name":["Fabrique Nationale FN49 pistol for sale"],"views":["181 total views, 1 today"],"url":"http://shooterswap.com/guns-for-sale/fabrique-nationale-fn49-pistol-for-sale/","image":["http://shooterswap.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/9413781.jpg"],"author":["monlon"],"listed_on":["Listed on October 6, 2011 onto Pistols"],"_template":"6cc5ec39847ae6af633a7ba5ead35958cac41797","location":["Location:"],"_cached_page_id":"2b981289ab849417dce0670943fbed8b1f50e1b5","price":["700.00"],"details":["Details: Zip/Postal Code: 75022 City: Allen State: Texas Listed: October 6, 2011 9:20 pm Expires: This ad has expired No Tags Ad Reference ID: 8624e8e1b23aedba"]},{"description":["Description Bought on March 9, 2012 from Gander Mountain.

Ergonomics and handling are identical to that of the MP5 with an overall length of 33.5 inches and a weight of 6.6 pounds which makes it an ideal training tool for Law Enforcement, Military personnel or civilians. 22 long rifle offers an immense savings over 9mm/40/45 caliber ammunition allowing extensive range time with the GSG-5 at a minimal cost to the user. Barrel length on the GSG-5 rifle is 16.25 inches including the faux suppressor, which surpasses federal requirements making it legal to own by anyone. The GSG-5 utilizes either a 22 or 10 rd detachable box magazine that releases with an H&K style paddle magazine release. The charging handle on the GSG-5 is located on the left side of the receiver and is non-reciprocating just like the H&K MP5 series. The GSG-5 comes standard with a conventional MP 5 style stock and fore end but American Tactical Imports also offers several different style stocks and tactical fore ends, including a side-folding stock like the H&K MP5k-PDW, and a retractable stock as offered on the H&K MP5A3. The GSG-5 comes with a standard H&K style fore end but is upgradeable to a tactical railed fore end that accepts tactical grips, lights and lasers. The GSG-5 utilizes the H&K style Drum sight that is windage and elevation adjustable. Accessories available for the GSG-5 include a claw mount with picatinny rail allowing just about any optic from a tactical or hunting scope to a Close Quarters Battle optic like a red dot sight to be mounted on the receiver. In addition to extra magazines ATI also offers a tactical magazine coupler for joining 2 magazines together making for a faster reload.

Built by a Pro Gunsmith using best of everything, this is the ultimate Zombie Killer, Riot control, Home defense or Entry/Assault Weapon test fired and ready to work or play. Check pictures for best description. This gun is loaded with extras, featuring a rare Knoxx Sidewinder Kit with the 10 round drum magazine, Knoxx forearm and 3 position broomstick handle, a Warhammer full length vented barrel shroud that bolts onto receiver and at the end of the barrel that has a full 20″ long top mounting rail,and 2 removable side rails, removable front ghost ring sight and flip-up rear sight set. The barrel was sent to Kings Armory for resizing threading and fitted with their KA1212BR Muzzle Brake/Breacher/Compensator, it is perm attached making the total barrel length approx 18 1/4″ legal length. This gun also has a Mesa Tactical AR-15 Stock adapter which allows use of any MIL-SPEC 4-5 position adjustable stocks and pistol grips, there are 3 sling mounts on the adapter, it has a Sig Sauer multi-position AR stock on it and an Ergo pistol grip. This gun has a total length of approx 35 3/4″ with the Sig Sauer stock fully collapsed, and approx 38 3/4″ with this stock fully extended. The buffer tube normally used with the AR collapsable stocks is replaced with the awesome Enidine Shot Stock #SH22898 4-position Hydraulic Recoil Reducer, which absorbs and reduces recoil by 70% or more and tames even the heaviest magnum loads. This gun feels more like a 410 or a 20GA even firing heavy loads one after the other, the Enidine Recoil Reducer is amazing. Also included with this gun is a new Streamlight Scorpion Tactical Flashlight with a quick release mount, a UTG removable front AR type front sight with a ClassIII laser sight and remote pressure switch, and a nice raised see-thru scope mount that will accept various types of optics systems. This gun is in near excellent condition, only a few cosmetic wear marks from normal use, and a scratch on the left side of receiver, barely noticable. It is ready to load and go, it feeds fires and cycles perfectly, no disappointments here, draws a crowd at the range pretty quickly once you start firing some 3″ heavy loads. Knoxx Sidewinder kits are getting very hard to find, and becoming collectors items. Dont want to sell it, but I must, over $1200. to build asking $750 or very close offer,ask questions if you have any email or call 512-757-0238. Thanks for looking.

Browning began to develop semi-automatic pistols for Colt company. In the 1906-1907 U.S. Army announced trials to replace its service revolvers with new, semi-automatic pistol. Army required the new pistol to have the caliber of .45 inch, so Browning designed its own cartridge that fired 230 grains (14.9 gram) bullet, and then, designed a new pistol. In 1911, after extensive testings, the new pistol and its cartridge, designed by Browning and manufactured by Colt, were adopted for U.S. military service as M1911. Prior to and during World War One, more than one million of these guns were manufactured, mostly by Colt and Springfield Armoury, as well as by Remington-UMC, Burroughs, Savage and some other companies. The rights to manufacture Colt/Browning design were also sold to some foreign countries, such as Norway or Argentine. In 1926, original design was improved, following the recommendations of the US Army Ordnanve Dept. These changes incorporate the following items (see picture above): Wider front sight Longer hammer spur Shorter trigger Curved spring housing Simplified grip panels checkering Index finger reliefs behind the trigger Longer grip-safety spur"],"_type":"win-custom-built-barrel-with-scope","name":["Colt M1911 for sale"],"views":["319 total views, 6 today"],"url":"http://shooterswap.com/guns-for-sale/colt-m1911-for-sale-2/?replytocom=279","image":["http://shooterswap.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/9114211.jpg"],"author":["monlon"],"listed_on":["Listed on December 23, 2011 onto Pistols"],"_template":"6cc5ec39847ae6af633a7ba5ead35958cac41797","location":["Location:"],"_cached_page_id":"992bddb4c2244fc6ed5fcdfe765d0ea8770adeae","price":["400.00"],"details":["Details: City: Galveston State: Texas Listed: December 23, 2011 8:42 pm Expires: This ad has expired No Tags Ad Reference ID: 1564ef4e527314c1"]},{"description":["Description Model: S&W M&P15 ($1069 M.S.R.P.)

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

The pistol displays the serial number MT2XXX meaning that it was manufactured in 1938 to early 1939, the first years Colt began manufacturing this particular model. This pistol additionally includes the sought after “Elephant Ear” walnut grips, the original 6-5/8” heavy barrel, and functional rear sight fully adjustable for both windage and elevation. The pistol also includes the original Match Target marked magazine correctly marked with the 3-line legend “COLT WOODSMAN” “CAL. 22 L.R.” “MATCH TARGET”. There is some bluing wear on the front of the barrel along with minor scratches; however the gun is in very good condition for its age.

Below is the description from Browning. These rifles that were produced in Belgium, vs Japan, have become highly collectible. Based upon condition and grade, these commonly sell for 700 to several thousands of dollars. This rifle has been well maintained, and only shows very minor signs of wear and age. The takedown mechanism is tight, and locks well for accuracy. This is a great shooting, fun rifle. I have more pictures, if you are interested. Browning Description – Auto 22 Semi-Auto-22. A living tribute to the genius of Browning. Few autoloading rimfire rifles have endured the test of time and the marketplace like the Browning SA-22. It stands alone as one of the first autoloading rimfires, and one the most desirable rifles ever made. The SA-22 was one of the last of John M. Browning’s designs, and his genius shines through in every feature. The slim, stylish forged steel receiver and slender barrel takes down into two compact units without tools. The SA-22’s tasteful engraving and select walnut make it an object of lasting beauty and enjoyment. Surely these rifles are meant to be enjoyed in the field as much as they are admired as heirlooms. Action Takedown autoloader with bottom ejection. Gun is 21″ long when taken down. Receiver Engraved with scroll design and a polished, blued finish. Sights Bead front. Adjustable, folding leaf rear. Barrel Drilled and tapped to accept a scope mount. Safety Manual trigger-blocking, mounted on trigger guard. Magazine Tubular. Capacity: 10 Long Rifles. Feeds through hole in stock.

Browning began to develop semi-automatic pistols for Colt company. In the 1906-1907 U.S. Army announced trials to replace its service revolvers with new, semi-automatic pistol. Army required the new pistol to have the caliber of .45 inch, so Browning designed its own cartridge that fired 230 grains (14.9 gram) bullet, and then, designed a new pistol. In 1911, after extensive testings, the new pistol and its cartridge, designed by Browning and manufactured by Colt, were adopted for U.S. military service as M1911. Prior to and during World War One, more than one million of these guns were manufactured, mostly by Colt and Springfield Armoury, as well as by Remington-UMC, Burroughs, Savage and some other companies. The rights to manufacture Colt/Browning design were also sold to some foreign countries, such as Norway or Argentine. In 1926, original design was improved, following the recommendations of the US Army Ordnanve Dept.

The sport originated in California in the 1980s and attracted people who had an interest in action pistol sports such as IPSC/USPSA but wanted to compete with Western-style firearms. The primary governing body for the sport, the Single Action Shooting Society, requires that all competitors’ firearms–either original or reproduction–be of a type that were in use before 1898, and as far as handguns go, only single-action revolvers are allowed. Shooters must also choose an alias and persona that reflects a character from the early West and dress in appropriate attire. While Cowboy Action is perhaps best known for the often gaudy Western clothing and shooters’ nicknames, it has led to a lot of attention to improving the firearms used by the competitors.

This cabinet was installed briefly and is perfectly functional. It is currently mounted so the finished product can be seen. . Everything is included to install the cabinet yourself or any handy man can install it. About the cabinet: Have you ever wanted your own secret place to store your treasures? Do you own a firearm and wish you had a place to keep it secure yet readily available? Do you own expensive jewelry you don’t wear because it’s kept in the safe or bank safety deposit box? Are you concerned about your children accidently getting into your medications? This versatile cabinet allows you to keep your precious or hazardous belongings out of sight yet readily available. The Hidden Storage Compartment is based on the idea of “hide in plain sight”. Almost every home has a full length mirror in the bedroom or bathroom. They are decorative and functional.

Otherwise the mirror stays firmly against the wall, no accidental open, no obvious key hole. The Hidden Storage Compartment is a very simple idea, stealth through deception. Turn an everyday, functional object into a secure location to store valuables items such as: Jewelry Pistols and rifles Ammunition Prescription drugs Checkbooks and cash most anything.

The Hidden Storage Compartment is designed for the Do It Yourselfer and installs easily with few tools. Installation consists of: – Picking a location based on simple rules (interior wall, wood studs set on 16 inch centers, no electric or plumbing running in wall) – Marking cabinet location and cutting out the sheetrock – Installing cabinet and door, and adjusting lock. If this seems like more than you are willing to do, any contractor or handy man can install it in less than an hour. The interior is huge. Inside, it’s tall enough to store rifles and flexible enough to store a variety of valuables. An optional jewelry kit organizes necklaces bracelets and earrings; even loose gems and stones or coins.

This shotgun was bought new in December and only has 15 shells through it. The gun was bought new for $450 and I added the black hawk talon recoil system in gen2camo. The recoil system was bought new for $150. The recoil system offers a thumbhole grip style and eliminates up to 65% of the initial recoil compared to a solid stock. The rifled barrel will accept up to 3″ shells. I will include the original stock and foregrip. Perfect for deer hunters wanting rifle-like performance in an affordable, yet dependable, shotgun package, the Model 870 Express Slug Gun utilizes fully rifled, heavy contour barrels to deliver devastating knockdown power with optimal accuracy. Available in both a 12-gauge and 20-gauge version, the added weight of the heavier slug barrel helps reduce the recoil of magnum slug loads while our cantilever system provides a solid scope mount platform that won’t lose its zero like other mounts. These pump-action shotguns feature a non-glare matte finish on all exterior metalwork and all-weather black synthetic stocks and fore-ends. The shotgun is in full camo, with nc star holo red dot sight, camo side saddle, camo sling, and rifle case. The sale value of the shotgun and accessories is $500. I also have 85 rounds of 2 3/4″ and 3″ slug shells valued at $1.25 each. Total sale value of shotgun and ammo is $600.. Do your research on the shotgun, the recoil system and ammo before you make any offers. This shotgun is comparable to the remington 870 sps shurshot slug camo system which retails at $749. $600 cash and everything listed above is yours. All the shells are winchester’s and winchester super X. 10 of the shells are home defense rounds valued at $3.50 each. I’m selling all the ammo at $1.25 each."],"views":["337 total views, 1 today"],"url":"http://shooterswap.com/guns-for-sale/remington-870-express-rifled-slug-shotgun/","price":["600"],"author":["r4o1s5s.pdwax"],"name":["Remington 870 express rifled slug shotgun"],"listed_on":["Listed on May 6, 2013 onto Shotguns"],"_template":"6cc5ec39847ae6af633a7ba5ead35958cac41797","location":["Location:"],"_cached_page_id":"43ba656fa8cc17ff381e59ac5641692bf641be1c","details":["Details: Zip/Postal Code: 75165 City: Waxahachie State: Texas Listed: May 6, 2013 4:01 pm Expires: This ad has expired No Tags Ad Reference ID: 4565187d2d00601e"]},{"description":["Description Romanian AK with 5 loaded mags. and 400 + or- extra ammo.rifle is like new, very few rounds fired.

I have recently incurred some personal expenses that need to be taken care of, which is the ONLY reason why I am selling. The rifle has been fired, and has about 100 rounds through it. I have shot several dpms, bushmaster, colt and SW ARs. I have been overly impressed with the performance of this rifle and its groupings, as well as its strong and reliable construction. I am not making money on this sale and my price has already firgured in a marginal loss on my part, which will be your gain.

Very Nice Cetme. Nicest I have seen. Bolt Gap is right in the middle of tolerance, every time. Approx. 50 rounds through it. No jams or failed ejections, even with non-Mil Spec ammo. No issues with HK Mags. Hesse Steel Receiver and Century Barrel / Trigger parts. CFR 91 compliant (not that anyone cares). I checked with CIA and this is NOT one of theirs. Likely a private build and very well done. Comes with 2 G3 mags (1-Steel, 1-Aluminum). Extra set of G3 OD Green furniture included. Sweet rifle. Sorry to see it go. Can’t afford to feed it. Price is negotiable. Email, call or text – 727-488-5994 Will consider partial trades (with cash): 22 LR or WMR semi auto pistol (NO, your PMR is NOT worth more, MSRP from Kel-Tec is STILL $450.00), cheap 9MM High Power clone, Calico 22, Any short barrel 44 SPL revolvers – early model CA Bulldog, S&W 396, Taurus M44, etc. M-1 Carbine Winchester 1887 shotgun clone. NOTE: I have received a lot of offers to trade for an SKS. I owned one once, years ago. An original Soviet 1952. Paid $59.00 for it. I appreciate the offers. But, I won’t own another. So, thanks anyway. Let’s talk. Let me know what you have. Due to a couple of unhappy and rude people, I feel compelled to address a couple of questions. tl/dr – Some of these rifles suck because of shoddy building, not because of parts defects or quality. There is a lot of bad information regarding the quality of the rifle, usually from people who had the misfortune of owning a not so good build. The truth, as is typical of the Internet, lies somewhere in the middle between the Manufacturer’s claims and the unhappy claims of the unsatisfied. The Cetme came before the HK G3, designed by a German. The original, or Model A, had a cast steel receiver, that was quickly replaced for a stamped steel one, to cut costs. 3 years later the Model B was produced, with modifications to the recoil and trigger groups. The Model B is what the HK G3 is based on, the primary differences being a shorter bolt, changes to the bolt locking mechanism and a stamped, aluminum (yes, aluminum) alloy receiver. You buy an original HK from Germany and you get a stamped aluminum receiver. The Model B was superseded by the Model C, with further changes to the bolt, flash suppressor and trigger group and replacement of the wood grip with a composite one. The vast majority of Cetme parts kits are Model C. The last model, the Model D, saw improvements to the feed mechanism and changes that were more manufacturing efficient. So, other than a the early Model A, the Cetme, and the G3, have never had Cast receivers. And aluminum is acceptable receiver material, as almost all the pressures on the rifle are in the barrel. The Hesse receivers get a lot of criticism. Century used Hesse receivers for their G3 and Cetme builds, for the first 2-3 years of production, before switching over to their own receiver. Though some are built with Hesse aluminum receivers, the vast majority are steel. The quality of the Hesse receivers is actually better than the Century ones. Hesse primary failing being in finishing, not in specification. And most of the problems with the Century builds relate to the actual build manufacturing, for both the Hesse and Century receivers. A critical component of the build is the so-call head spacing issue. The rifle design incorporates a trunion, which is press fitted in to the receiver end. The trunion holds the barrel, also press fitted, to the end of the receiver. Proper Head spacing is achieved by both proper alignment and placement of the trunion in the receiver and proper placement of the barrel in the trunion. The specifications for head space on the G3 and Cetme are actually quite wide, considering, with better performance, the closer you are to the center of that tolerance range. And since head spacing determines where the bolt (and the cartridge) end up in relation the chamber, bad head spacing can effect every aspect of the rifle’s firing cycle from stripping and feeding a cartridge, to casing extraction and ejection. The manufacturing process requires the trunion be fitted correctly and then welded to the receiver. The barrel is then inserted and spaced for proper head gap, then it is locked in place by a lock pin. This is a very simple process for the original manufacturers, who have machines designed to perform exactly these tasks on this particular design. It is a tedious and labor consuming task for a builder, without this automation. Which brings us to the build issues. Century cut costs and time in builds by inserting and pinning the barrels in to the trunion and then press fitting both barrel and trunion together, in to the receiver. While faster, it doesn’t ensure appropriate and consistent headspacing for every rifle. Nor does it protect the integrity of the receiver Add to this, that Century has also, when encoun"],"_type":"win-custom-built-barrel-with-scope","name":["FS?FT-Negotiable-Cetme Battle Rifle 308 (Spanish G3) 7.62×51 NATO"],"views":["511 total views, 2 today"],"url":"http://shooterswap.com/guns-for-sale/fsft-negotiable-cetme-battle-rifle-308-spanish-g3-7-62x51-nato/","image":["http://shooterswap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/52288-610x457.jpg"],"author":["bozobonzo"],"listed_on":["Listed on June 4, 2013 onto Rifles"],"_template":"6cc5ec39847ae6af633a7ba5ead35958cac41797","location":["Location:"],"_cached_page_id":"0763f64e83eb03636bd97478343b578e10e1c1fe","price":["800.00"],"details":["Details: Zip/Postal Code: 34654 City: Pasco State: Florida Listed: June 4, 2013 5:13 am Expires: This ad has expired No Tags Ad Reference ID: 31951ad76369bce7"]},{"description":["Description Browning bolt action 30-06, comes with scope."],"_type":"win-custom-built-barrel-with-scope","name":["Browning Safari 30-06"],"views":["193 total views, 2 today"],"url":"http://shooterswap.com/guns-for-sale/browning-safari-30-06/","image":["http://shooterswap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/516262.jpg"],"author":["sakelley2"],"listed_on":["Listed on January 6, 2012 onto Rifles"],"_template":"6cc5ec39847ae6af633a7ba5ead35958cac41797","location":["Location:"],"_cached_page_id":"707fece9b404d5110b88047f1535d2684f12f813","price":["400.00"],"details":["Details: City: Beecher Listed: January 6, 2012 9:07 pm Expires: This ad has expired No Tags Ad Reference ID: 7874f07604d5ebde"]},{"_type":"win-custom-built-barrel-with-scope","description":["Description Marlin 308 MXLR Zeiss 3 X 9 X 50 email for photos, can’t get them to upload. hpranch@dishmail.net"],"views":["131 total views, 2 today"],"url":"http://shooterswap.com/guns-for-sale/marlin-308-mxlr/","price":["1000.00"],"author":["ramarable"],"name":["Marlin 308 MXLR"],"listed_on":["Listed on January 9, 2012 onto Rifles"],"_template":"6cc5ec39847ae6af633a7ba5ead35958cac41797","location":["Location:"],"_cached_page_id":"3eb9ef78d3d55bddae16ec10ddeb33b6245eb077","details":["Details: This item has been sold Zip/Postal Code: 75147 City: Mabank State: Texas Listed: January 9, 2012 3:40 pm Expires: This ad has expired No Tags Ad Reference ID: 2854f0b083985e18"]},{"_type":"win-custom-built-barrel-with-scope","description":["Description interarms ultrastar 40 40cal great shooting gun extra clipalmost new shot 1 time in box tool an cleaning rod , great buy at 250.00 !!!"],"views":["459 total views, 3 today"],"url":"http://shooterswap.com/guns-for-sale/ultra-star-40-pistol/?replytocom=6806","price":["250.00"],"author":["tman"],"name":["ultra star 40 pistol"],"listed_on":["Listed on June 15, 2013 onto Pistols"],"_template":"6cc5ec39847ae6af633a7ba5ead35958cac41797","location":["Location:"],"_cached_page_id":"22511ba8de5067c93f16c946ac894eff1644c9e6","details":["Details: Zip/Postal Code: 31024 City: eatonton State: Georgia Listed: June 15, 2013 1:35 am Expires: This ad has expired No Tags Ad Reference ID: 2951bbc0139a9e5"]},{"description":["Description Charles Daly 12 gauge 3.5 inch maxi-mag pump Field Shotgun in excellent, like new condition. no scratches, used very little. 28″ Vented rib barrel with choke tube included. 4+1 capacity.

The use of a lighter, narrower bullet results in a significantly higher muzzle velocity and superior ballistic performance to the .50 BMG, supposedly to such a degree that the .416 Barrett retains more energy than the .50 beyond 1000 yards. The projectile remains supersonic to out around 2000 yards. That’s my typical ground squirrel shooting range. That’s why I bought the Barrett. Ha, ha, ha. Heck, I can’t even SEE 2000 yards! I saw one ballistic chart that said the Barrett puts a 400gr bullet at 3250fps with a resulting muzzle energy of 9380 foot pounds. That’s around twice the .458 Winchester magnum! Those ballistics will provide greater accuracy than the .50 beyond 1000 yards. This rifle is brand new in the box. It is chambered in the .416 Barrett. It comes with one 10rd magazine. It is housed in a Pelican 1750 case with a custom moulded interior designed specially for the rifle so it is held securely."],"views":["185 total views, 1 today"],"url":"http://shooterswap.com/guns-for-sale/barrett-82a1-82-416/","price":["4800.00"],"author":["gudgod"],"name":["Barrett 82A1 82 416"],"listed_on":["Listed on November 28, 2012 onto Rifle Ammunition"],"_template":"6cc5ec39847ae6af633a7ba5ead35958cac41797","location":["Location:"],"_cached_page_id":"1525e68cc1fc31fc3408ce082552b1ce16182596","details":["Details: Zip/Postal Code: 78704 City: Austin State: Texas Listed: November 28, 2012 3:54 pm Expires: This ad has expired No Tags Ad Reference ID: 2950b6320823e8b"]},{"_type":"win-custom-built-barrel-with-scope","description":["Description This is an LIKE NEW HK MR556A1 IN FLAWLESS CONDITION.

The capacity is 15+1 and includes TWO spare 15RND OEM mags. Carried with a 2-mag pouch, you have 46 rounds available. This handgun has been cleaned and lubed after every shooting session and has never experienced a jam or failure to fire. It has been fed all variety of ammunition ranging from reloads to generic to name brands. This pistol has a reputation of being rock-solid and outperforming its successor (the P89). I can confirm the superiority of this P85 over the P89, having challenged a P89 owner at the range. We both, using the P85, handily outshot the P89. Will sell ONLY to Wisconsin CCL holder. The U.S. Army gave consideration to the P85 as its standard issue sidearm to replace the M1911A1. The P85 met the Army’s performance requirements, including the military’s requirement for a 20,000-round life expectancy. The P85 was adopted by the Wisconsin State Patrol as its standard issue sidearm., leading the way for numerous other organizations across the country and internationally as well. The P85 quickly earned an enviable reputation of being able to digest any 9 mm load—from NATO M882 FMJ cartridges to hollow points—without a hiccup. Plus, it was as rugged as an M1 Abrams tank. There are many substantiated reports of guns being dropped, kicked and even run over, yet still coming up shooting. This handgun is in almost excellent shape with only some very slight slide wear on one side of the muzzle. This pistol currently has a Blue Book value of $350 for NIB. As this is not NIB, I have set the price at a FIRM $280 (cash) This pistol comes with the original hard case, original padlock, 3×15 OEM mags, and loader. Will coordinate face-to-face transfer within Milwaukee County or nearby. Contact me for additional photos/views if desired. Video is available at https://youtu.be/s3ipy8TS038 Manual is available online at: https://ruger-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/_manuals/p85.pdf The following questions have been asked by interested parties: Am I the original purchaser? YES. THIS IS A SINGLE-OWNER FIREARM. Is the original instruction manual included? NO. I THOUGHT I STILL HAD IT, BUT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO LOCATE. THE LINK FOR THE ONLINE MANUAL HAS BEEN PROVIDED IN THE POSTING. Is there any rust at any location on the handgun? ABSOLUTELY NONE. THIS FIREARM HAS BEEN CLEANED AND LUBED AFTER EVERY SHOOTING SESSION. Does the P85 accept +P loads? YES. RUGER DOCUMENTATION SPECIFIES +P LOADS ARE ACCEPTABLE. What is the material used in the Fobus holster? IT IS A SORT OF KYDEX FEEL. THE HOLSTER IS SPECIFICALLY MOLDED TO HOLD THE P85 SECURELY, YET EASILY RELEASE WITH A QUICK FIRM DRAW. What is the condition of the magazines? ALL THREE MAGAZINES ARE LIKE NEW. NO RUST. FULL SPRING COMPRESSION/POWER. THE MAGAZINES ARE ALSO CLEANED/LUBED AFTER EVERY SESSION. Have any parts been replaced, repaired, or upgraded? NO. ALL COMPONENTS ARE FACTORY OEM, INCLUDING THE MAGAZINES. Have you fired anti-personnel rounds with the P85? YES. I HAVE RUN A VARIETY OF ANTI-PERSONAL ROUNDS OF VARIOUS DESIGNS. NONE HAS EVER CAUSED ANY PROBLEM. THIS IS A RELIABLE FIREARM THAT GOES “BANG” EVERY TIME YOU PULL THE TRIGGER."],"_type":"win-custom-built-barrel-with-scope","name":["9mm Ruger P85 MkII w/3x15RND OEM Mags"],"views":["1103 total views, 12 today"],"url":"http://shooterswap.com/guns-for-sale/9mm-ruger-p85-mkii-w3x15rnd-oem-mags/?replytocom=7264","image":["http://shooterswap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/224244-610x458.jpg"],"author":["P85ForSale"],"listed_on":["Listed on November 18, 2015 onto Pistols"],"_template":"6cc5ec39847ae6af633a7ba5ead35958cac41797","location":["Location:"],"_cached_page_id":"87176e1d4e7594a3c41f3528e214ed615e59fdaf","price":["280.00"],"details":["Details: This item has been sold Zip/Postal Code: 53224 City: Milwaukee State: Wisconsin Listed: November 18, 2015 9:14 pm Expires: This ad has expired No Tags Ad Reference ID: 328564cea3dcf7ee"]},{"description":["Description This is a package deal.

This early rifle was imported by Claco Sports located in Clay Center Kansas and these types were featured in the September 1984 (pgs42~45) Edition of Soldier of Fortune Magazine. These were circa late 1983-84 before the deluge of Norincos and Polytecs arrived on the American import markets.
